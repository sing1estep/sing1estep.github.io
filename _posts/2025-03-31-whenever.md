Welcome to the blog. This is largely an experiment to measure how much traffic and interaction one gets by posting a blog and "verifying" oneself on social media, as well as a place just to put down some random thoughts and longer form items vs. the standard short-form stuff that is so popular now.
Some general notes: this may end up being more shitposting vs. useful Information Security knowledge, so don't have high hopes for training material, or deep insights on how to hack or catch hackers.
